# Succession

This system devloped based on PM-IBS Process model. 
This repository contains the implementation of a blockchain-based property registration and succession system. The system automates property registration, death certificate issuance, and property succession using Ethereum smart contracts. These contracts, embedded with notary algorithms, ensure the authenticity and accuracy of property records and ownership succession.

Key Features:

Property Registration on Blockchain: Secure and tamper-proof record of property ownership.
Automated Succession Process: On an individual's demise, a death certificate issued by an authorized organization triggers the smart contract to transfer property to the designated successor.
Authenticity and Security: Validation of death certificates and successor identities by smart contracts.
Tackles Traditional System Challenges: Addresses issues like lengthy legal procedures, lack of transparency, and fraud risks in conventional property systems.
The system is built using Solidity on the Ethereum network. It features smart contracts deployed on the blockchain and a web interface for user interaction. The project focuses on correctness, security, and efficiency in implementation. Tests demonstrate that our system offers a viable, secure, and efficient solution for managing property ownership and transfer with minimal human intervention. This approach promises to revolutionize property registration and succession, making the processes more efficient, transparent, and secure.
